Convention rules are guidelines that enforce consistent practices and coding patterns across a project. These rules aim to enhance readability, maintainability, and overall code quality by adhering to widely accepted best practices. They typically focus on the structure, style, and efficiency of code, helping developers avoid anti-patterns and ensure that the project follows uniform conventions.

By applying convention rules, teams can create a more collaborative and coherent development environment where code is predictable, easier to review, and less error-prone.
